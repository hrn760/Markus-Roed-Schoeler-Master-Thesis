This page contains all the data, code, and graphs used in my Master Thesis :
Monetary Shocks and Stock Markets: Analyzing Sectoral and Cross-Country Responses in Denmark and the U.S.

The final dataset i use is too large to upload to Github. However, it can be recreated using the ticker, shocks, and implied volatility dataset combined with the R code.
